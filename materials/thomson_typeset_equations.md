### Thomson Scattering
Thomson scattering is the form of light scattering from an electron most relevant to this kind of diffraction.

$$ E_{rad}(R, t) = -E_{x0} {r_0} \frac{e^{i(kR-\omega t)}}{R} cos \psi$$

$R$ represents the distance between the point of scattering and the point of observation.

$t$ represents the time of observation.

$e_{x0}$ represents the amplitude of the incident electric field.

$r_0$ represents the classical electron radius, which is about 2.82x10-15 m.

$e$ is Euler's number, and $i$ is the copmlex number.

$k$ is the wavenumber of the incident electric field.

$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the incident electric field.

$\psi$ is the angle at which the scattering is observed, relitive to the plane of polarization for the incident electric field.


From an atom, the equation is 

$$ E_{rad} = 2 \pi  \int_{R=0}^{R=\infty} \int_{\psi = 0}^{\psi = \pi} \frac{e^{ikR}}{R} (R^2 sin \psi) drd\psi $$

With the same variable definitions as before.
